# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

-     // Divide the number by another number using integer division


 // Sort the list using the Collections library
    arrList.sort(null);


    // Iterate over the keys of the Map, printing each key
    stuff.forEach(System.out.println("stuff"));

    // Iterate over the values of the map, printing each value
    //ssame trouble with syntax above

    // Iterate over the entries in the map, printing each key and value
    
    / Join all of the strings in the list together into a single string separated by commas
    // Use a built-in method to achieve this instead of using a loop
